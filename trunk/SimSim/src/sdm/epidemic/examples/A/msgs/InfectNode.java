/**
 * Example of a custom message sub-type.
 * 
 * Messages sub-types may include fields and methods. Static fields are not allowed, because they violate
 * the assumptions of a distributed system. Moreover, you should treat messages as read-only after they 
 * are created, sent or received. If you need to modify messages, as they as forwarded across the system,
 * then extend SerializedMessage instead of Message. This ensures that a private copy is delivered to
 * each recipient. That form is much slower and should be avoided if possible. 
 *
 * Message and SerializedMessages CAN BE mixed.
