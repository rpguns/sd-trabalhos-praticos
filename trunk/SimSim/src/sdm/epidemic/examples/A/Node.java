/**
 * This class is used to simulate an autonomous node of a Distributed System.
 * 
 * Each node acts independently and schedules tasks to simulate parallel execution.
 * <b>IMPORTANT</b>. You must not use threads; only tasks and periodic tasks can be used to simulate concurrency in the simulator.
 * 
 * In this example, all nodes but one start healthy; the infected node is chosen at random, at the beginning of the simulation. 
 * 
 * In every node, a periodic task executes every second. In healthy nodes, this task does nothing until they become infected. When that happens, 
 * every time the task is executed, the node will send an InfectNode message to another node, chosen randomly, to infect it. 
 * This is more than enough to cause the infection to spread quickly.
 * 
 * Healthy nodes in the system are represented as green dots in the Main simulator window.
 * Infected nodes are represented in red. 
 * 
 * Every time the simulation window is updated, the simulator also draws the message traffic observed in that period.
